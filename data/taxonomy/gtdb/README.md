GTDB taxonomy
=============

The [**GTDB**](http://gtdb.ecogenomic.org/) taxonomy (release 86.1) of the sampled genomes. Of all 10,575 genomes analyzed in this project, 9,732 have corresponding GTDB assignments, in which 8,042 are present in the two GTDB trees.

- [translate.txt](translate.txt): Genome ID translation table (also available in [genomes/metadata.tsv](../../genomes/metadata.tsv.xz)).
- [ranks.tsv](ranks.tsv.xz): GTDB taxonomy names at ranks.
- [lineages.txt](lineages.txt.xz): Greengenes-style lineage strings.
- [stats.tsv](stats.tsv): Properties and metrics of taxonomic units.
- [trees](trees): GTDB trees with translated genome IDs.

And:

- [curation](curation): tax2tree-curated taxonomy for tips and nodes (missing genomes are filled).
