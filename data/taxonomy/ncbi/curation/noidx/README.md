## Curated taxon names without index

Go to [GitHub directory](https://github.com/biocore/wol/tree/master/data/taxonomy/ncbi/curation/noidx).

The numeric suffixes indicating polyphyly were stripped from taxon names, so that they precisely match original NCBI taxon names.

- [lineages.txt](lineages.txt.xz): Curated Greengenes-style lineage strings.
- [ranks.tsv](ranks.tsv.xz): Curated taxonomic assignments by rank.

See also [taxid](../taxid), which hosts TaxIDs instead of taxon names.
