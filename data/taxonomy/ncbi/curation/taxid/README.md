## Curated taxonomy IDs

Go to [GitHub directory](https://github.com/biocore/wol/tree/master/data/taxonomy/ncbi/curation/taxid).

Curated taxon names were translated back to taxonomy IDs. Note: The numeric suffixes indicating polyphyly are gone, and the IDs precisely match original NCBI taxonomy IDs.

- [ranks.tsv](ranks.tsv.xz): Curated taxonomic assignments by rank.
- [taxid.map](taxid.map): Mapping of genome IDs to taxonomy IDs.
- [nodes.dmp](nodes.dmp): Shrinked NCBI nodes file containing relevant taxonomy IDs.
- [names.dmp](names.dmp): Shrinked NCBI names file containing relevant taxonomy IDs.

See also [noidx](../noidx), which hosts original taxon names instead of IDs.
