Trees by taxonomic rank
=======================

Go to [GitHub directory](https://github.com/biocore/wol/tree/master/data/trees/ranks).

Phylogenetic [tree](../tree.nwk) collapsed to taxa at given taxonomic ranks. For example, a "genus tree" is a phylogenetic tree in which every tip is a genus.

Both NCBI and GTDB taxonomies are provided. Because of the incongruence between taxonomy and phylogeny, taxonomy was curated using **tax2tree** to match phylogeny. Some taxon names have an "underscore index" suffix compared with the original names. See [taxonomy](../../taxonomy) for details.
